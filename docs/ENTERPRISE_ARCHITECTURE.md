# Enterprise Architecture - Adara from Hebron™

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the enterprise architecture standards, governance, and implementation roadmap for the Adara digital kiosk content management platform. The architecture supports multi-tenant operations across UAE with enterprise-grade security, scalability, and compliance requirements.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Security-First Design
- Zero-trust security model
- Defense in depth strategy
- PII protection by design
- Compliance-driven architecture

### 2. Cloud-Native Architecture
- Microservices-based design
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Event-driven processing
- Serverless where appropriate

### 3. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Company-scoped data isolation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Resource quotas and limits
- Independent scaling per tenant

### 4. Mobile-First Architecture
- Flutter cross-platform development
- Android TV/tablet/kiosk optimization
- Offline-first content delivery
- Real-time synchronization with conflict resolution

### 5. Digital Twin Integration
- Virtual device representation for remote management
- Predictive maintenance using AI analysis
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Automated issue detection and resolution

Repository status: Digital twin UI and mirroring are implemented in the repo. See `frontend/src/app/dashboard/digital-twin/page.tsx` for the UI and `backend/content_service/app/websocket_manager.py` plus `backend/content_service/app/api/websocket.py` for the backend mirroring and control channels. Device health monitoring code is present in `backend/content_service/app/monitoring/device_health_monitor.py`.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, FastAPI, MongoDB
- **Cloud Integration**: Azure services foundation
- **Microservices Ready**: Service-oriented design principles
- **API-First**: RESTful API design with OpenAPI support

### ❌ Critical Gaps
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Hardcoded secrets, no PII encryption
- **Scalability Limitations**: Single-instance deployments
- **Monitoring Deficits**: Limited observability and alerting
- **Compliance Gaps**: Incomplete audit trails and data governance

Repository note: Several monitoring and observability components exist in code (audit logger, device health monitor). See `backend/content_service/app/security/audit_logger.py` and `backend/content_service/app/monitoring/` for implemented pieces that should be wired to Application Insights / Log Analytics in production.
