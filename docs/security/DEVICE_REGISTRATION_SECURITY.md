# 🛡️ Enhanced Device Registration Security System

## Overview

The OpenKiosk platform now includes a comprehensive device registration security system that prevents abuse, detects suspicious activity, and ensures only legitimate devices can register with the platform.

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting Protection
- **Hourly Limit**: Maximum 5 registration attempts per IP address per hour
- **Daily Limit**: Maximum 20 registration attempts per IP address per day
- **Automatic Blocking**: IPs are blocked after 10 consecutive failures
- **Block Duration**: 30 minutes for temporary blocks
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old attempt records (24 hours)

### 2. Enhanced Device Fingerprinting
- **Hardware Fingerprinting**: CPU ID, motherboard info, device serial
- **Network Fingerprinting**: MAC addresses, IP address analysis
- **Software Fingerprinting**: OS version, user agent, locale
- **Capability Detection**: Screen resolution, supported formats, hardware features
- **Geographic Analysis**: Timezone and locale-based risk assessment

### 3. Risk Scoring System
- **IP-based Risk**: Failed attempts, geographic location
- **Temporal Risk**: Registrations outside business hours
- **Device Risk**: Missing fingerprint data, weak identifiers
- **Behavioral Risk**: Multiple rapid attempts, bot detection
- **Threshold**: High-risk registrations (≥7.0) require review

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **All Attempts**: Success and failure logging with timestamps
- **IP Tracking**: Source IP addresses with proxy detection
- **Device Information**: Device names, fingerprints, capabilities
- **Failure Reasons**: Detailed failure analysis
- **Security Events**: Blocks, unblocks, high-risk detections

### 5. Enhanced Key Validation
- **Expiration Checking**: Time-based key expiration
- **Usage Tracking**: One-time use enforcement
- **Age Analysis**: Detection of suspiciously old keys
- **Company Validation**: Verified company association
- **Uniqueness Checks**: Prevention of duplicate device names

## 📊 Security Monitoring

### Real-time Statistics
Access security statistics via: `GET /api/device/registration/stats`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statistics": {
    "total_registration_attempts": 45,
    "successful_registrations": 32,
    "failed_registrations": 13,
    "success_rate": 71.1,
    "blocked_ip_addresses": 2,
    "recent_attempts_last_hour": 5,
    "active_monitoring_ips": 8,
    "total_registered_devices": 32,
    "total_registration_keys_issued": 50
  }
}
```

### Security Status Dashboard
Monitor security level via: `GET /api/device/security/status`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "security_status": {
    "level": "normal",
    "blocked_ip_count": 2,
    "recent_failed_attempts": 13,
    "device_status_breakdown": {
      "active": 28,
      "pending": 4
    },
    "total_monitored_ips": 8,
    "last_updated": "2025-08-31T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

Security levels:
- **normal**: Standard operation
- **elevated**: Some suspicious activity detected
- **high**: Multiple security events, requires attention

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

### Blocked IP Management
If an IP is incorrectly blocked, administrators can unblock it:

```bash
POST /api/device/registration/unblock-ip
{
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

### High-Risk Registration Review
High-risk devices (risk score ≥7.0) are automatically flagged for manual review:

- Device status set to `PENDING` instead of `ACTIVE`
- Security profile logged for administrator review
- Additional verification may be required

### Monitoring Alerts
The system logs security events that should trigger alerts:

- **Multiple blocked IPs**: Potential coordinated attack
- **High failure rates**: Possible brute force attempts
- **Unusual registration patterns**: Off-hours activity spikes
- **High-risk devices**: Devices requiring manual verification

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Rate Limiting Settings
```python
# In enhanced_device_registration.py
max_attempts_per_hour = 5       # Hourly limit per IP
max_attempts_per_day = 20       # Daily limit per IP
block_duration_minutes = 30     # Block duration
high_risk_threshold = 7.0       # Risk score threshold
```

### Risk Scoring Weights
- Failed attempts: 0.5 points each (max 3.0)
- Off-hours registration: 1.0 point
- Weak fingerprint: 2.0 points
- No MAC addresses: 1.0 point
- Missing user agent: 1.5 points
- Bot detection: 3.0 points
- Multiple recent attempts: 2.0 points

## 🔄 API Migration Guide

### New Enhanced Endpoint
**New (Recommended)**: `POST /api/device/register/enhanced`
- Full security features enabled
- Comprehensive rate limiting
- Advanced risk assessment
- Detailed audit logging

**Legacy**: `POST /api/device/register`
- Basic security features
- Maintained for backward compatibility
- Will show deprecation warning

### Flutter App Updates
The Flutter app has been updated to use the enhanced endpoint:

```dart
// Updated API call
final response = await http.post(
  Uri.parse('$baseUrl/device/register/enhanced'),
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: jsonEncode(registrationData),
);
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Monitor Statistics**: Regularly check registration statistics
2. **Review High-Risk**: Manually verify high-risk device registrations
3. **Update Keys**: Rotate registration keys regularly
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for suspicious IP patterns
5. **Set Alerts**: Configure monitoring for security events

### For Device Registration
1. **Use Strong Keys**: Generate cryptographically secure registration keys
2. **Set Expiration**: Always set reasonable expiration times for keys
3. **Limit Scope**: Create company-specific registration keys
4. **Track Usage**: Monitor which keys are being used
5. **Revoke Unused**: Remove unused or expired keys

### For Network Security
1. **IP Whitelisting**: Consider whitelisting known device subnets
2. **VPN Protection**: Require VPN access for remote registrations
3. **Certificate Validation**: Implement proper TLS certificate validation
4. **Proxy Detection**: Monitor for proxy/VPN usage patterns

## 📈 Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Registration Success Rate**: Target >95%
- **False Positive Rate**: Target <5% (legitimate devices blocked)
- **Time to Block**: Malicious IPs blocked within 10 attempts
- **Response Time**: Security checks complete within 2 seconds

### Monitoring Dashboard Items
1. Registration attempts per hour/day
2. Success vs failure rates
3. Blocked IP count and trends
4. High-risk device percentage
5. Average risk scores
6. Geographic distribution of attempts

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Too many registration attempts"
- **Cause**: Rate limiting triggered
- **Solution**: Wait for rate limit to reset or contact admin to unblock IP

#### "Registration key has already been used"
- **Cause**: Attempting to reuse a one-time registration key
- **Solution**: Generate a new registration key

#### "Device registration flagged for review"
- **Cause**: High risk score (≥7.0)
- **Solution**: Wait for manual approval or contact administrator

#### "IP address temporarily blocked"
- **Cause**: Multiple failed registration attempts
- **Solution**: Contact administrator to unblock IP using unblock endpoint

### Debug Information
Enable debug logging to see detailed security assessment:
